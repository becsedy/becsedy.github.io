There were several CSS design changes that were implemented in this website. First, the font-family property was set to Arial, sans-serif, so that the text appeared in Arial or a similar sans-serif font if Arial was unavailable. The text aligning was set to left, which aligned all text to the left by default. The background color of the navigation bar was set to a dark blue #3333AA, and the padding was set to 10px, adding space inside the navigation bar to improve its appearance and readability. The nav a selector was used to style the links inside the navigation bar, where the color was set to white, making the text color white for better contrast against the dark blue background and the text decoration was set to underline dotted, underlining the links with a dotted line. Additionally, the margin property was set to 10px, adding spacing between the links to make them more visually appealing and easier to distinguish. Finally, the .content class allowed the padding to be set to 20px, ensuring that the website was easy on the eyes.
