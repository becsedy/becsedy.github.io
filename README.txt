Submission:

The personal website is located at https://becsedy.github.io, which should have the personal and interest landing pages.
The D3 graphics are stored in and connected to the d3_plots.html file, which should show all of the plots when deployed.
The D3 graphics do not load when deployed from the personal website's landing page, so run the d3_plots.html *separately* using Live Server in VS Code.
