    <h2>More About My Trip to Iceland</h2>

    <p>I had previously been to Europe a couple times with my family: Italy
        in 2022, and England and France in 2023, but this was my first time
        co-ordinating a trip with my friends to the continent (although I'm
        unsure whether calling Iceland "the continent" would be correct). As a
        vegetarian and a lover of exploring cities and nature, two things
        that were really important to me during the planning phase of this trip
        were to find delicious restaurants with vegetarian offerings, and to
        find fun activities for my friends and I to do to get immersed in both
        Icelandic culture and Icelandic natural beauty.

        Picking the trips were relatively easy to do, since we all had a similar
        budget of what we were willing to spend on the tripa nd also had a
        good idea of what we would all want to do together, but finding
        restaurants in the vicinity of our AirBnb that were relatively cheap
        while also accommodating to all of our dietary needs and preferences
        was no easy task. One of our friends doesn't like vegetables, another
        disliked seafood, I'm a vegetarian, another friend was basically
        vegetarian, so it was tough to decide consistently on places to eat
        where all seven of us would enjoy. Despite this, we found many places
        that served really good food that satisfied all of us.
