    <h2>My Professional Life</h2>

    <p>I am a fourth-year honors undergraduate student from Southbury, CT 
        studying mathematics, physics, and data science at Northeastern
        University. From an early age, I have been fascinated by the power of
        data and its potential to solve complex problems, and this fascination
        has led me to take on academic and career experience in all three
        subjects, obtained by taking classes and working on several projects. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Through these projects, I have contributed to the design of management
        software for a small rocket payload system, developed a prototype
        application in AppSmith for a hospital database management system,
        created an interactive travel interface for analyzing the
        characteristics of different travel itineraries, and partnered with
        InnSure Corporation to analyze data regarding employees of 800+
        insurance companies to mitigate social engineering and cyber-attacks
        on these companies.
    </p>

    <p>
        My professional journey has further honed my skills and fueled my
        interest in applying data-driven approaches to real-world challenges.
        At Finwave Semiconductor, I developed a comprehensive library of
        statistical and numeric methods for analyzing and visualizing
        measurement data, which significantly enhanced the efficiency of
        research and design processes. I also consulted existing engineering
        literature to create a predictive numerical model for the thermal
        behavior of semiconductor devices, achieving results with high accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, I have work experience as an administrative assistant,
        where I designed and implemented a logistical storage system for a
        manufacturing company, and as a research assistant under a Northeastern
        University professor, where I assisted in the compilation of a database
        of grant and funding information for non-profit organizations.
    </p> 

    <p>
        I love working on all things technical and data-based and I take pride
        in my work ethic, my continual strive to learn, and my curiosity about
        how the world works.
    </p>

    <h2>Iceland!</h2>

    <p>
        I just got back from a trip to Reykjavik, Iceland with my friends for
        spring break; it was a bit cold, but we had a lot of fun exploring all
        the beautiful nature that the country had to offer. (I'm second from
        the right)
